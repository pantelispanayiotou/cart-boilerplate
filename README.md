# SHOPPING CART BOILERPLATE USING REACTJS + REDUX

This is a basic shopping cart boilerplate and is intended for beginners that wish to learn reactjs and the redux state management library. It contains the following actions: 
- ADD PRODUCTS
- CHANGE QUANTITY
- DELETE PRODUCT
- CLEAR CART

It also detects the products that are added more than once, groups them together and updates the total and the quantity.
